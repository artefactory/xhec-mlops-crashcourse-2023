# Prerequisites and Setup

> [!Important]
> The course is dense.
>
> You won't have time to install and configure everything during on D-day.
>
> You won't be able to follow the course if you don't have everything installed and working.
>
> ðŸ“£ **Please make sure you have everything installed and working before the course starts.** ðŸ“£
>
> You know your school WiFi better than we do, don't gamble on it.

> [!Important]
> We will be using Docker for this course, which can use up a lot of your disk.
> Make sure to have at least 10Gb available in your disk before starting this course. Otherwise you risk running into some obscure errors.

> [!Note]
> Each section has a **Check your Installation** section.
> Please make sure you can run the commands in that section before moving on to the next section.

## Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is a tool for MacOS and Windows machines for the building and sharing of containerized applications and microservices. It includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Notary, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. It also features an intuitive user interface that makes managing your Docker images and containers locally much easier.

### Download and Install Docker Desktop

> ðŸ“£ **This step is the most time consuming one. You will not be able to perform it at HEC.** ðŸ“£

If you do not have `Docker Desktop` installed, you will need to install it. You can follow the official instructions:

* [Install Docker - Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
* [Install Docker - Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
* [Install Docker - Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

For those of you working on Windows, you might need to update Windows Subsystem for Linux. To do so, simply open PowerShell and run:

```bash
wsl --update
```

### âœ… Check your Installation

Once docker is installed, make sure that it is running correctly by running:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

If you check the Docker App, you should see a getting started container running. Once you've checked that this works correctly, remove the container via the UI.

<details>
    <summary><b>Optional</b></summary>
    You can also perform these operations directly from the command line, by running <code>docker ps</code> to check the running containers and <code>docker rm -f [CONTAINER-ID]</code> to remove it.
</details>

## Pull a Docker Image

During session 2 of this course, you will need to build a Docker image yourself. To speed up the building process, you can pre-build your image.

Place your terminal at the root of the project and run:

```bash
docker build -t "nyc-taxi:prerun" -f "lessons/02-model-deployment/app.Dockerfile" ./lessons/02-model-deployment
```

### âœ… Check that it works

You should be able to see your image in the Docker Desktop UI:

![Docker Image](./images/example_image.png)

You can also check that it worked that by running:

```bash
$ docker images
> REPOSITORY   TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
> nyc-taxi     prerun     1878dadc8ab5   6 minutes ago   118MB
```

## Install Git

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes.
It's essential for any collaborative coding project.

#### Download & Install
To install Git, follow the instructions on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
Choose the instructions that match your operating system.

After installation, you can verify that Git is correctly installed by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
git --version
```

This should return the version of Git that you installed.

#### Configure Git

After installing Git, you need to configure it with your name and email address.
This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it's immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you email@foo.bar"
```

You can find full configuration instruction on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

### [OPTIONAL] Windows only: `git bash`

If you are using Windows, you can use PowerShell as your terminal.
But Powershell is limited and doesn't support all the commands we will use in this course.
You will need to install [`git bash`](https://gitforwindows.org/) to have access to all the commands we will use in this course.

Please carefully follow [instructions here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.42.0.windows.2).

### âœ… Check your Installation

You should be able to run the following commands:

```bash
git --version
```

```bash
git config --global --list
```

## Install Conda + Python

### MiniConda

### âœ… Check your Installation

## Create Conda Environment and check requirements
