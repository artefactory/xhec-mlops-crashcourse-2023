## Install Git

### Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes.
It's essential for any collaborative coding project.

#### Download & Install
To install Git, follow the instructions on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
Choose the instructions that match your operating system.

After installation, you can verify that Git is correctly installed by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
git --version
```

This should return the version of Git that you installed.

#### Configure Git

After installing Git, you need to configure it with your name and email address.
This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it's immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you email@foo.bar"
```

You can find full configuration instruction on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

### [OPTIONAL] Windows only: `git bash`

If you are using Windows, you can use PowerShell as your terminal.
But Powershell is limited and doesn't support all the commands we will use in this course.
You will need to install [`git bash`](https://gitforwindows.org/) to have access to all the commands we will use in this course.

Please carefully follow [instructions here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.42.0.windows.2).

### âœ… Check your Installation

You should be able to run the following commands:

```bash
git --version
```

```bash
git config --global --list
```
